    <p>I am a board-certified music therapist and counselor integrating talk therapy and creative projects to explore emotions, build resilience, and foster meaningful change. I provide individualized therapy sessions as well as community arts programming for youth centers — including bands, lessons, and performances — and creative arts therapy programs for outpatient cancer treatment at a hospital.</p>
    
    <p>My approach to therapy is collaborative, creative, and rooted in understanding how our past shapes our present. I believe that the relationships and experiences we have in childhood play a significant role in shaping who we are today. Reflecting on these dynamics can give insight into patterns, help process unresolved emotions, and clarify how they influence your current beliefs, behaviors, and relationships. In our sessions, I create an environment where you can openly work through your thoughts and feelings while incorporating creative outlets to express emotions that may be hard to put into words. This can include lyric analysis of songs that resonate with your experiences, music making and art as mirrors to reflect on personal challenges, and creative prompts. I approach creativity with curiosity, exploring how it can help you connect with your inner thoughts and uncover new perspectives. My goal is to empower you to rewrite narratives that no longer serve you and build a sense of self you are truly proud of.</p>
    
    <p>I hold a master’s degree in cognitive behavioral science from Freie Universität Berlin and an undergraduate degree in psychology and music therapy from the Berklee College of Music in Boston.</p>
