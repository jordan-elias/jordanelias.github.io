    <p>I am a music therapist and counselor integrating talk therapy and creative projects to explore emotions, build resilience, and foster meaningful change.</p>
    <p>My approach to therapy is collaborative, creative, and rooted in understanding how our past shapes our present. I believe that the relationships and experiences we have in childhood play a significant role in shaping who we are today. Reflecting on these dynamics can give insight to patterns, process unresolved emotions, how they influence your current beliefs, behaviors, and relationships. In our conversations I aim to create an environment where you can openly work through your thoughts and feelings. At the same time, I like to incorporate creative outlets to help you express and explore emotions that might be harder to put into words. This might include lyric analysis of songs that resonate with your experiences, using music making and art as a mirror to reflect on personal challenges and deeper feelings, and creative prompts. I believe in approaching creativity with curiosity, exploring how it can help you connect with your inner thoughts and uncover new perspectives. My goal is to help you feel empowered to rewrite the narratives that no longer serve you and build sense of self you’re truly proud of.</p>
    <p>I hold a master’s degree in cognitive behavioral science from Freie Universität Berlin and an undergraduate degree in psychology and music therapy from the Berklee College of Music in Boston.</p>
