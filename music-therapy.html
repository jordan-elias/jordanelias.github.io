    <p>Music therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to support mental, emotional, physical, and social wellbeing. It is facilitated by trained professionals who tailor music experiences, such as listening, songwriting, improvisation, and instrument playing, to meet the unique needs of each client or group.
A brief history: music as medicine
Humans have turned to music for healing and connection for millennia.

In Ancient Greece, philosophers like Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle wrote about music’s ability to influence mood, behavior, and health. Pythagoras believed that music mirrored the harmony of the cosmos and could restore balance in the human body.

In cultures across the world, music has long played a role in rituals of healing, mourning, and community bonding.

In the 20th century, a new wave of music's healing potential emerged. After World Wars I and II, musicians began volunteering in hospitals to play for soldiers returning with trauma and injuries. Doctors noticed that these musical visits lifted patients’ spirits, reduced pain, and encouraged emotional expression.

This sparked the development of formal music therapy training programs and the eventual establishment of music therapy as a professional, evidence-based field.

How does music therapy work?
Music engages the brain in powerful and unique ways. It taps into:

Emotional memory and regulation

Motor coordination and timing

Speech and language pathways

Reward and motivation systems

Social bonding and empathy

In music therapy, these natural processes are guided intentionally to:

Reduce anxiety, depression, and stress

Support emotional expression

Improve communication

Enhance memory and attention

Aid in trauma processing

Foster connection and community

Who can benefit?
Music therapy supports people across the lifespan and with a wide range of needs. Some examples include:

Individuals navigating anxiety, depression, burnout, or grief

Neurodivergent youth and adults, including those with autism or ADHD

People recovering from brain injuries or neurological conditions

Artists and musicians seeking creative recovery and emotional balance

Anyone looking for a deeper connection to themselves and others through music

No musical experience is necessary, just a willingness to explore.</p>
