  <p>Music therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to support mental, emotional, physical, and social wellbeing. Sessions are tailored by trained professionals who use activities such as listening, songwriting, improvisation, and instrument playing to meet the unique needs of each client or group.</p>

  <p><strong>A brief history: music as medicine</strong></p>
  <p>Humans have turned to music for healing and connection for millennia. In Ancient Greece, philosophers like Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle wrote about music’s ability to influence mood, behavior, and health. Pythagoras believed that music mirrored the harmony of the cosmos and could restore balance in the human body. Across cultures, music has played a role in rituals of healing, mourning, and community bonding.</p>

  <p>In the 20th century, the healing potential of music was recognized in hospitals, where musicians volunteered to play for soldiers returning from the World Wars with trauma and injuries. These musical visits lifted patients’ spirits, reduced pain, and encouraged emotional expression. This history led to the formal establishment of music therapy as a professional, evidence-based field.</p>

  <p><strong>How does music therapy work?</strong></p>
  <p>Music engages the brain in unique ways, tapping into:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emotional memory and regulation</li>
    <li>Motor coordination and timing</li>
    <li>Speech and language pathways</li>
    <li>Reward and motivation systems</li>
    <li>Social bonding and empathy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In music therapy, these natural processes are guided intentionally to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce anxiety, depression, and stress</li>
    <li>Support emotional expression</li>
    <li>Improve communication</li>
    <li>Enhance memory and attention</li>
    <li>Aid in trauma processing</li>
    <li>Foster connection and community</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>My personal approach</strong></p>
  <p>My music therapy sessions are highly personalized and creative, integrating a range of methods to help clients explore and express their emotions. Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Life Review Playlists:</strong> Curating playlists that reflect meaningful moments in a client’s life to help process experiences and connect with memories.</li>
    <li><strong>Chord or Soundscape Check-Ins:</strong> Identifying chords or textures that represent current moods to provide a musical mirror of emotional states.</li>
    <li><strong>Body Awareness Through Sound:</strong> Using instruments, rhythm, or vocal exercises to connect with the body and present moment, particularly for those who over-intellectualize emotions.</li>
    <li><strong>Masked/Unmasked Sound Pieces:</strong> Creating compositions that explore the contrast between internal feelings and external presentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Songwriting & Lyric Writing:</strong> Processing emotions and experiences through original music and lyrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Sound Sampling:</strong> Recording and incorporating sounds from specific places into musical projects, fostering connection to the environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploring Uncertainty Through Indeterminate Music:</strong> Using techniques from indeterminate music to create improvisations or pieces that reflect uncertainty in life, followed by verbal discussion to explore how unpredictability feels in both music and personal experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Who can benefit?</strong></p>
  <p>Music therapy supports people across the lifespan and a wide range of needs, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Individuals navigating anxiety, depression, burnout, or grief</li>
    <li>Neurodivergent youth and adults, including those with autism or ADHD</li>
    <li>People recovering from brain injuries or neurological conditions</li>
    <li>Artists and musicians seeking creative recovery and emotional balance</li>
    <li>Anyone looking for a deeper connection to themselves and others through music</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No musical experience is necessary, just a willingness to explore and engage creatively.</p>

  <h3>Client Testimonials</h3>
  <section class="testimonials">
    <blockquote>"I was looking for online therapists with experience in autism, and having recently picked up electronic music synthesis as self-soothing medium, this approach particularly resonnates"</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"I recently moved to Berlin, and things didn't seem to work out no matter how hard I tried. I am also a music producer, but getting out of bed became difficult and joy was scarce. I started finding it pointless to practice things like gratefulness, mindfulness, meditation — practices I would once eagerly enjoy. Working with a therapist who understands the challenges musicians face  has been exactly what I need to move forward with my life, and process some challenging inner experiences and narratives."</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"It has been so nice to combine music education with more psychological education and have some more guidance with pursuing my passion"</blockquote>
