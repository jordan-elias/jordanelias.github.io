  <p>Music therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to support mental, emotional, physical, and social wellbeing. Sessions are tailored by trained professionals using activities such as listening, songwriting, improvisation, and instrument playing to meet the unique needs of each client or group.</p>

  <p><strong>A brief history: music as medicine</strong></p>
  <p>Humans have used music for healing and connection for millennia. From Ancient Greece to modern hospitals, music has been shown to lift spirits, reduce pain, and support emotional expression. Music therapy has since evolved into a professional, evidence-based field supporting diverse populations.</p>

  <p><strong>How music therapy works</strong></p>
  <p>Music engages the brain in ways that facilitate emotional regulation, social connection, motor coordination, and cognitive engagement. In therapy, these processes are intentionally guided to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce anxiety, depression, and stress</li>
    <li>Support emotional expression and processing</li>
    <li>Enhance communication and social skills</li>
    <li>Foster connection and community</li>
    <li>Encourage creative exploration and self-expression</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>My approach</strong></p>
  <p>Sessions are highly personalized, integrating conversation, music-making, songwriting, improvisation, and creative prompts. Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Life Review Playlists:</strong> Using music to reflect on meaningful experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Chord or Soundscape Check-Ins:</strong> Musical reflection of current emotional states.</li>
    <li><strong>Body Awareness Through Sound:</strong> Rhythm, instruments, and vocal exercises to connect with the present moment.</li>
    <li><strong>Songwriting & Lyric Analysis:</strong> Creative expression to process feelings and experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Sound Sampling:</strong> Incorporating place-based sounds to foster connection to environment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Who can benefit?</strong></p>
  <p>Music therapy supports:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adults experiencing anxiety, depression, burnout, or trauma</li>
    <li>Neurodivergent individuals, including ADHD and autism</li>
    <li>People recovering from brain injuries or neurological conditions</li>
    <li>Artists and musicians seeking emotional support and creative development</li>
    <li>Anyone seeking connection to self and others through music</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No musical experience is required; just openness to explore creatively.</p>
